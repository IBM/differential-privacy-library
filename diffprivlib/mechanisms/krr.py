class KRR(DPMechanism):
    r"""
    The k-RR mechanism - also known as flat mechanism or randomized response
    mechanism - is one of the simplest LPD mechanisms. It can be visualized as
    a generalization of the randomised response proposed by [Warner, 1965].
  
    The k-RR mechahism returns the original value of an attribute domain with
    probability :math:`\frac{e^\varepsilon}{|X|-1+e^\varepsilon}` and returns
    any other value different from the original with probability
    :math:`\frac{1}{|X|-1+e^\varepsilon}`, where :math:`|X|` is the domain
    size. P. Kairouz, S. Oh, and P. Viswanath has showed that the mechanism is
    optimal in the low privacy regime for a large class of information
    theoretic utility functions.
