    Ordinary least squares Linear Regression with differential privacy.

    LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients w = (w1, ..., wp) to minimize the residual sum of squares
    between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.  Differential
    privacy is guaranteed with respect to the training sample.

    Differential privacy is achieved by adding noise to the second moment matrix using the :class:`.Wishart` mechanism.
    This method is demonstrated in  [She15]_, but our implementation takes inspiration from the use of the Wishart
    distribution in  [IS16]_ to achieve a strict differential privacy guarantee.

    Parameters
    ----------
    epsilon : float, default: 1.0
        Privacy parameter :math:`\epsilon`.

    data_norm : float, optional
        The max l2 norm of any row of the concatenated dataset A = [X; y].  This defines the spread of data that will be
        protected by differential privacy.

        If not specified, the max norm is taken from the data when ``.fit()`` is first called, but will result in a
        :class:`.PrivacyLeakWarning`, as it reveals information about the data.  To preserve differential privacy fully,
        `data_norm` should be selected independently of the data, i.e. with domain knowledge.

    bounds_X:  tuple, optional
        Bounds of the data, provided as a tuple of the form (min, max).  `min` and `max` can either be scalars, covering
        the min/max of the entire data, or vectors with one entry per feature.  If not provided, the bounds are computed
        on the data when ``.fit()`` is first called, resulting in a :class:`.PrivacyLeakWarning`.

    bounds_y : tuple
        Same as `bounds_X`, but for the training label set `y`.

    fit_intercept : bool, default: True
        Whether to calculate the intercept for this model.  If set to False, no intercept will be used in calculations
        (i.e. data is expected to be centered).

    copy_X : bool, default: True
        If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

    accountant : BudgetAccountant, optional
        Accountant to keep track of privacy budget.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : array of shape (n_features, ) or (n_targets, n_features)
        Estimated coefficients for the linear regression problem.  If multiple targets are passed during the fit (y 2D),
        this is a 2D array of shape (n_targets, n_features), while if only one target is passed, this is a 1D array of
        length n_features.

    rank_ : int
        Rank of matrix `X`.

    singular_ : array of shape (min(X, y),)
        Singular values of `X`.

    intercept_ : float or array of shape of (n_targets,)
        Independent term in the linear model.  Set to 0.0 if `fit_intercept = False`.
