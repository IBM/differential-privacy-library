class LogisticRegression(linear_model.LogisticRegression):
    r"""Logistic Regression (aka logit, MaxEnt) classifier with differential privacy.

    This class implements regularised logistic regression using :ref:`Scipy's L-BFGS-B algorithm
    <scipy:optimize.minimize-lbfgsb>`.  :math:`\epsilon`-Differential privacy is achieved relative to the maximum norm
    of the data, as determined by `data_norm`, by the :class:`.Vector` mechanism, which adds a Laplace-distributed
    random vector to the objective.  Adapted from the work presented in [CMS11]_.

    This class is a child of :obj:`sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`, with amendments to allow for the
    implementation of differential privacy.  Some parameters of `Scikit Learn`'s model have therefore had to be fixed,
    including:

        - The only permitted solver is 'lbfgs'.  Specifying the ``solver`` option will result in a warning.
        - Consequently, the only permitted penalty is 'l2'. Specifying the ``penalty`` option will result in a warning.
        - In the multiclass case, only the one-vs-rest (OvR) scheme is permitted.  Specifying the ``multi_class`` option
          will result in a warning.

    Parameters
    ----------
    epsilon : float, default: 1.0
        Privacy parameter :math:`\epsilon`.

    data_norm : float, default: None
        The max l2 norm of any row of the data.  This defines the spread of data that will be protected by
        differential privacy.

        If not specified, the max norm is taken from the data when ``.fit()`` is first called, but will result in a
        :class:`.PrivacyLeakWarning`, as it reveals information about the data. To preserve differential privacy fully,
        `data_norm` should be selected independently of the data, i.e. with domain knowledge.

    tol : float, default: 1e-4
        Tolerance for stopping criteria.

    C : float, default: 1.0
        Inverse of regularization strength; must be a positive float. Like in support vector machines, smaller values
        specify stronger regularization.

    fit_intercept : bool, default: True
        Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be added to the decision function.

    max_iter : int, default: 100
        Maximum number of iterations taken for the solver to converge.  For smaller `epsilon` (more noise), `max_iter`
        may need to be increased.

    verbose : int, default: 0
        Set to any positive number for verbosity.

    warm_start : bool, default: False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as initialization, otherwise, just erase
        the previous solution.

    n_jobs : int or None, default: None
        Number of CPU cores used when parallelising over classes.  ``None`` means 1 unless in a context. ``-1`` means
        using all processors.

    **unused_args : kwargs
        Placeholder for parameters of :obj:`sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` that are not used in
        `diffprivlib`.  Specifying any of these parameters will raise a :class:`.DiffprivlibCompatibilityWarning`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    classes_ : array, shape (n_classes, )
        A list of class labels known to the classifier.

    coef_ : array, shape (1, n_features) or (n_classes, n_features)
        Coefficient of the features in the decision function.

        `coef_` is of shape (1, n_features) when the given problem is binary.

    intercept_ : array, shape (1,) or (n_classes,)
        Intercept (a.k.a. bias) added to the decision function.

        If `fit_intercept` is set to False, the intercept is set to zero. `intercept_` is of shape (1,) when the
        given problem is binary.

    n_iter_ : array, shape (n_classes,) or (1, )
        Actual number of iterations for all classes. If binary, it returns only 1 element.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    >>> from diffprivlib.models import LogisticRegression
    >>> X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
    >>> clf = LogisticRegression(data_norm=12, epsilon=2).fit(X, y)
    >>> clf.predict(X[:2, :])
    array([0, 0])
    >>> clf.predict_proba(X[:2, :])
    array([[7.35362932e-01, 2.16667422e-14, 2.64637068e-01],
           [9.08384378e-01, 3.47767052e-13, 9.16156215e-02]])
    >>> clf.score(X, y)

        that should be used. In this case, the parameters will be chosen in a logarithmic scale between 1e-4 and 1e4.

    max_iter : int
        Maximum number of iterations for the solver.

    tol : float

    coef : array-like, shape (n_features,), default None
        Initialization value for coefficients of logistic regression. Useless for liblinear solver.

    class_weight : None
        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``. For diffprivlib, only ``None`` is
        permitted. Specifying any other value will throw a warning.

    dual : bool
        Dual or primal formulation. Only `False` is permitted for diffprivlib.

    penalty : str, 'l2'
        Used to specify the norm used in the penalization. For diffprivlib, only l2 penalties are permitted.

    intercept_scaling : float, default 1.
        For diffprivlib, only intercept_scaling=1 is permitted.

    multi_class : str, {'ovr'}, default: 'ovr'
        For diffprivlib, only 'ovr' is permitted.

    random_state : None
        For diffprivlib, only None is permitted.

    check_input : bool, default True
        If False, the input arrays X and y will not be checked.

        For diffprivlib, only None is permitted.

    sample_weight : None
        For diffprivlib, only None is permitted.

    Returns
    -------
    coefs : ndarray, shape (n_cs, n_features) or (n_cs, n_features + 1)
        List of coefficients for the Logistic Regression model. If fit_intercept is set to True then the second
        dimension will be n_features + 1, where the last item represents the intercept. For
        ``multiclass='multinomial'``, the shape is (n_classes, n_cs, n_features) or (n_classes, n_cs, n_features + 1).

    Cs : ndarray
        Grid of Cs used for cross-validation.

    n_iter : array, shape (n_cs,)
        Actual number of iteration for each Cs.
